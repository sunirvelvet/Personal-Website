    <h1>Gem Vault: Valuable Discoveries for 21st century Humans.</h1>
    <p class="des">Welcome to Gem. This is page where I share discoveries that I find fascinating and valuable. Here, you'll find stuff like—YouTube videos, articles, tweets, clips, and books—that I believe will contribute to you as a human regardless of your pursuit. I may organize these resources into categories for easier navigation. It's important to note that the content isn't all original; rather, it's a collection of valuable findings I've stumbled upon, some shared by friends and individuals I genuinely respect. I don't claim credit for any of these discoveries as not all are sourced by me. Additionally, I'll be sharing insights I've gained, realizations and my own work as well, offering a blend of external discoveries and personal reflections. My aim is to present what I consider truly worthwhile and beneficial for your time and growth.

                    <p>This is a blog post about products that makes you less stress over stupid things, and will make you more productive.<br>worth checking the comments here as well, readers share there own top findings.
                        The site mentions, happiness : but I would use "less stressed",cause let's face it "happiness is skill to be learnt not to be achieved by gaining external thing."

                    <p>
                        Game theory helps us understand how people make choices when their decisions depend on others' actions, studying strategies in situations where individuals' moves affect each other. It's a way to analyze interactions, as seen in economics, biology, and social situations, to predict outcomes and make better decisions. This is a simple 10-minute game that will give you some understanding of the games you play every day without even noticing. This was actually on the Less Wrong blog, but incase you did not notice it.

                    <p>This includes why prescriptions ("How to's," "How do I get rich?") are bad. This podcast will provide you no realizations; that's your duty to figure out. But it's worth your time listening.

                    <p>I'm linking the essay site as a whole here as well because he talks about different fields. You can choose by yourself based on your pursuit. My friend told me that PG's essays are the bible in Silicon Valley. Most of the articles here are titled as "how to do x," but I recommend you not blindly follow anyone. Read it to understand his experiences, knowledge, and wisdom he has shared and is trying to share in the book. Then reflect on who he is and his intentions in writing. Let this information guide your own original thinking.

                    <p>This is basically a Chrome extension that will blank out your YouTube homepage so that you are not constantly distracted by the internet.
                         It has options to block other social media as well, but I'm not sure if it works all the time.
                        Both the social media sites and these extensions are constantly updated.
