        <h1>Gem Vault: Valuable discoveries for 21st century Humans.</h1>
            <p class="des">Welcome to Gem. This is page where I share discoveries that I find fascinating and valuable. Here, you'll find stuff like—YouTube videos, articles, tweets, clips  and books—that I believe will contribute to you as a human regardless of your pursuit. I may organize these resources into categories for easier navigation. It's important to note that the content isn't all original; rather, it's a collection of valuable findings I've stumbled upon, some shared by friends and individuals I genuinely respect. I don't claim credit for any of these discoveries as not all are sourced by me. Additionally, I'll be sharing insights I've gained, realizations and my own work as well, offering a blend of external discoveries and personal reflections. My aim is to present what I consider truly worthwhile and beneficial for your time and growth.

                        Game theory helps us understand how people make choices when their decisions depend on others' actions, studying strategies in situations where individuals' moves affect each other. It's a way to analyze interactions, as seen in economics, biology, and social situations, to predict outcomes and make better decisions. This is a simple 10-minute game that will give you some understanding of the games you play every day without even noticing. This was actually on the Less Wrong blog, but incase you did not notice it.

                    <p>I am linking the essay site as whole here as well, as he talks about different fields, you can choose by yourself based on your pursuit. My friend told me that PG essay's are bible in Silicon Valley. Most of the article here are titled here as "how to do x.", but I reccomend you not blindly follow anyone. Read it in a way that to understand his experience's, his knowledge, and wisdome he has shared and is trying to share in the book, then reflect on who he is and his intentions to write something. Then let this information guide your own original thinking.

                    <p>This is basically chrome extension, that will blank out your youtube, homepage. So that those Bastards can't steal your time. It has options to block other social media as well, but not sure if it all works all the time. Both the social media sites and these extensions are on constant update.<br>For Mobile use:<a href="https://www.opal.so/">Opal</a> ( Free / Good to get rid off instagram addiction.)<br>This might help: <a href="https://blockerx.net/">BlockerX </a><br>Porn is the 21st century Cyber Drug:<br>
                        “For all the older generation who like to brag much about how blessed we are to have internet and now LLM right aside us. I like to tell them that we are equally cursed with spread out cyber drug all over the internet.” Drug addicts have Rehabilitation Center's , Cyber Drug addicts are on there own, and you might not have even guessed it even instagram and twitter is clearly a drug, as addictive as cocaine and affecting neuroplasticity in your brain and resulting in slower learning curve and almost zero original thinking. Internet is Hyper Sexual let's face it and as this shit is declared a Taboo, we are seriously fuck*d without knowing for most time , you know that waking up type of situation, you wake up and shit’s already in your head.<br> No Cartels. No Mafia, No violence. Direct Supply to kids as young as since they have phone in there hand.<br>I’m not the type of guy who is against technology, rather I am the most technoptipist guy you will ever meet.<br> But as generation who will be first to step foot on Mars and first generation to be interstellar species, we have to be all time aware of things that’s messing us up.<br> Direct Approach: If you think you can’t live without Social Media or any thing else you are addicted to cause of work related reasons or educational reasons.  Don’t use it for a day. (I was gonna say 30 day’s but I am assuming as you are reading this deep, you are already in this trap, so your limit remains just one day.)  And see how much did I loose today? Then decide by yourself.<br>Indirect Approach: “Extreme Physical pursuit is parallel to Extreme Mental Pursuit”,  not one or other, this is mistake I made. By completely cutting off workout , balanced diet including every single thing even talking with my family: While I was starting to learn full stack development.<br>But leaving other things aside: I realized that it actually helps to be constantly pushing yourself both mentally and physically at same time.<br> I don’t know scientific details but this is what worked for me.<br>”Your mind never needs rest it needs change.”<br>And we are all individuals in this battle. Only thing I can say is use all tools you got.
