        <h3>Who am I ?</h3>
        <p>
        I am Sunir, 18 years old . I am currently learning full stack development. <br>I’m Junior National Swimmer for Nepal.<br>I dropped out of high school to come to United States to start a Startup. I did not even clearly knew what startup to start. I did not even knew clearly where I was going to stay and how I was going to even survive. Yet I had enough balls (clarity) to just come here with $700, a Sony tablet that died the day I came here , and Dell Laptop ( with 4 hour battery life).<br>And I am that 16 year old who hacked his way to United States all legally. <br><br><br></p><div class="section">

        <h3>What I work on ?</h3>
        <p>
        I am currently learning Full Stack Development  Full Time by myself ( obviously have best people around me that I could  ever have all the time ) while building things to reinforce learning. <br><br>I have partial clarity of what I want to work on so I am working on that as well. <br><br><br></p>
        <h3>What Interests me ?</h3>
        <p>
        Cars, I have connection to cars, from as early as I could think, and I asked people who know me from birth as well. I had deep interest for these machines humans use to transport themselves, but mainly it has been cars. <br><br>If you ask me, what is one thing that no-one can beat Sunir at, it would be cars( obviously not specialized areas like racing or car repairs, as I haven't focused on one specific direction yet).But, in general I have yet to encounter a man who knows more about cars than I do , even if I met a professional they only know about there specific field and is most cases for sake of money not original. <br><br>I usually have never said this to anyone other than people who know me long enough. I never felt needed to. So this would be something that you would not want to compete with me in. Do not try to compare yourself with me in this topic I’m afraid you’ll feel bad. It’s so vast that you won’t be able to capture in lifetime. <br><br>I've never undergone any formal automotive education or courses. But since a very young age ( 4 years old ) pre-verb age. I was expressing extreme love for cars. Noticing the type of Cars, the purpose of its big wheels, this was also not because I had anyone close to me who was super passionate about cars as well. It was undeniably innate. Actually as I got to teens , I was insane fanatic about cars. I knew encyclopedic knowledge of nearly every detail about cars (except deep technical specifics). My parents urged me to shift my focus from cars to studies, but my passion for cars was too compelling.  , my passion was so strong for cars that I could make anyone talking with me interested about cars (did this to my father and one of my grandparent). When I was between 4-10 I knew all airlines that existed in Nepal ( For this came from my father worked for Finnish Project and he regularly use to visit airline offices to book tickets , and he used to bring home airline calendars, and those calendars had pictures of aircraft, I can’t describe how much I loved those calendars.), I knew all airlines that existed in Nepal at that time. And all motorcycles that was on streets and all cars that was being run. <br><br>People who met me and talked with me long enough usually walk away surprised ( How could this kid possibly know this much about cars? ) <br><br>I was never a kid who read books until late teens, I was the horrible student and really bad at studies in school. For most part I was against school, but one thing that I loved reading was Auto life that came out once a month. My father bought me a couple of these. I would not just read the book but study them. <br><br>And I am not type of kid who just loves sports cars. It was not about that. When I was a kid around 4.5 years old , according to my grandmother and mother , I use to jump and clap whenever I saw tractor or a bull-dozer on the balcony as I grew up at the capital city in main city center area and there you could just see regular cars and motorcycles not construction vehicles. <br><br>Also it was not that I was passionate about everything.  It was just cars, motorcycles , planes, ( The way humans/ people transported themselves: I recently had this reflection after long conversation with my parents and meditation: So I myself don’t know , how to put it in words. )<br><br>And to equal it out, just as you are gifted you are cursed as well. I bought into the idea of letting go of interest for cars since last 3 years to focus on my career. I was never able to entirely kill it, things I did was so dumb, whenever I saw an elegant car passing by I would just close my eyes or turn over. <br><br>This was brutal. Imagine a child being taken away from mother and is not allowed to see her child and have to close her eyes, when child is passing by. <br><br>Now I am recovering. <br><br>
        Other things that I have interest for are : Mega-Structures, Energy ( I have interest in these but I don’t have enough clarity yet, to act upon it, this is something I need to be more clear about. ) <br><br>My Focus is on Cars for now. As I recover from the injury : I am going to be directing this drive towards changing the way Humans Transport themselves in next 10 to 50 years.<br><br>How we transport ourselves and how we will transport everything else. <br><br><br></p>

        <h3>Standards I live by</h3>
        <p>
        I like brutal honesty, directness and critical feedback .<br><br>I  take control of things what I can , rest I leave it to God. Focus on what you can do.<br><br>

        What has happened has happened past is out of your control.  <br><br>
